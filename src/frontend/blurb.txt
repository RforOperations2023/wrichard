This dashboard allows you to look through Elo scores for all players in the FIDE player data set, available for download from the organization's website. Select from three different distribution visualizations: Histogram, Frequency Plot, and Density Plot. Group by a category of your choosing, and select a time control to display ratings for that control in the plot. The table below the plot will show the 10 highest-rated players from your selected time rating and any other filters you give, such as birth year and country.
